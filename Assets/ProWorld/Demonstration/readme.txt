#Notes#
The Terrain Assets and Basic Water packages are included but stored in the Asset folder to prevent potentially overriding modified versions of them that you may have in your project already. It is suggested to remove them once you are done with the demonstration to reduce clutter in your project.
Water (Pro) looks significantly better than Water (Basic) but isn't provided in demo as not everyone has access to Pro.
